MECHANISM: By explicitly modeling these characteristics as regularization targets, the model internalizes constraints that reduce off\u2011distribution behavior and align latent representations with human feedback, thereby improving compliance with intended objectives, which is central to \"AI safety\". TEST: Perform an ablation study on a standard alignment benchmark (e.g., OpenAI Alignment Dataset) where the regularization terms derived from the surveyed characteristics are removed from a baseline auto\u2011alignment system; evaluate both alignment loss and downstream harmful output rate after 14 days of training.
