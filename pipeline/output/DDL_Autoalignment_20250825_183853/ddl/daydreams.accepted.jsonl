MECHANISM: By exposing each instance to distinct log subsets or instruction tweaks, the model samples different latent pathways, reducing mode collapse and surfacing complementary failure modes that a monolithic prompt would miss. TEST: Conduct an ablation where all instances receive identical prompts and compare critique diversity against the full varied\u2011context ensemble on the AI Alignment Awards evaluation set. SIGNALS: A significant drop in pairwise BLEU or semantic similarity scores and lower human\u2011rated coverage of edge cases would support the claim, whereas unchanged or improved diversity would refute it.
